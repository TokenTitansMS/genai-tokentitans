The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Platform will facilitate direct lending between individuals, providing an alternative to traditional banks. The system ensures transparency, security, and automation while maintaining a streamlined architecture with minimal external dependencies.

Users will be able to:

Register & Verify Identity â€“ Secure onboarding with basic authentication.

Request & Provide Loans â€“ Borrowers submit loan applications; lenders browse lending opportunities.

Match & Approve Loans â€“ Simple matching process based on predefined criteria.

Automate Repayments â€“ Scheduled payments and reminders.

Provide Secure Transactions â€“ for now will not have payment gateway just have an option to enter amout whcih is paid.

Monitor Loan Performance â€“ Dashboard for tracking loan status and repayments.

ðŸ›  Basic Needs & User Roles
User Roles
Borrower â€“ Requests a loan, agrees on terms, makes repayments.

Lender â€“ Provides funds, sets risk tolerance, earns interest.

Admin â€“ Monitors compliance, fraud prevention, and overall system health.

Core Features
User Registration & Authentication â€“ Basic username-password system using Flask.

Loan Marketplace â€“ Borrowers post loan requests; lenders browse and select.

Simple Loan Matching â€“ Algorithm-based matching between lenders & borrowers.

Transaction Handling â€“ Simple ledger system instead of full payment gateway integration (for now).

Loan Repayment Tracking â€“ Basic scheduler to manage repayment timelines.

Dashboard for Users â€“ View loans, repayments, and available lending opportunities.

ðŸ§© System Architecture
Frontend (React)
React.js â€“ Handles dynamic UI interactions.

Redux (Optional) â€“ Manages global state if needed.

Styled Components / Tailwind CSS â€“ For UI styling.

Axios â€“ Communicates with Flask backend.

Backend (Flask)
Flask â€“ Lightweight API for handling requests.

Flask-SQLAlchemy â€“ ORM to interact with MySQL.

Flask-JWT-Extended â€“ Basic authentication system.

Flask-Mail (Optional) â€“ Send loan reminders via email.



Message Table (Optional) â€“ Allows borrower-lender communication.

Security & Authentication
JWT Authentication â€“ Secure login sessions.

Basic KYC System â€“ Store minimal verification details like ID submission. (will not verify with govt sites for now)

AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean (Optional for scaling) â€“ Simple hosting solutions.







Sure! Let's break down the components of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Platform and tackle them one by one. Here's the breakdown:

1. User Registration & Authentication
Frontend: React form for user registration and login.
Backend: Flask API for user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.
Database: User table to store user credentials and roles.
2. Loan Marketplace
Frontend: Borrowers can post loan requests, and lenders can browse available loans.
Backend: Flask API to handle loan creation and retrieval.
Database: Loan table to store loan details.
3. Loan Matching
Backend: Simple algorithm to match borrowers and lenders based on predefined criteria.
Database: Extend the Loan table to include matching status.
4. Transaction Handling
Backend: Flask API to log transactions (lending and repayments).
Database: Transaction table to store transaction records.
5. Loan Repayment Tracking
Backend: Scheduler to send reminders for repayments.
Database: Extend the Loan table to track repayment status.
6. Dashboard
Frontend: Dashboard for borrowers and lenders to view loans, repayments, and opportunities.
Backend: Flask API to fetch dashboard data.
7. Admin Panel
Frontend: Admin interface for monitoring compliance and fraud prevention.
Backend: Flask API for admin-specific actions.
8. Logging & Monitoring
Backend: Use Python's logging module for backend logs.
Frontend: Use browser console logs for debugging.
9. Documentation
README: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage.
Code Comments: Add comments to explain logic in both frontend and backend.
Step 1: User Registration & Authentication
Letâ€™s start with User Registration & Authentication. Below is the implementation plan:

Backend (Flask)
Create a Flask app with endpoints for:
User registration (/register)
User login (/login)
Use Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT-based authentication.
Create a User table in MySQL.
Frontend (React)
Create a registration and login form.
Use Axios to communicate with the Flask backend.
